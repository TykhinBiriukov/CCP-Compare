# CPP Compare

Project was created as part of my Algorithms & Data Structures class in University. 

The main point of programme is to create 2D field which randomly filled with points. After that programme apply Naive and Advaneced methods to find closest pair of points and compares the time spent

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

-- Used Languages --
- Java

-- Naive Method --

- The programme searches through all pairs of points and records the smallest distance. If there is a pair of points where the distance is less than the current minimum, the value of the minimum is updated.

--Advaneced Method--

- The program divides the area in half by x and finds the smallest distance between points in these rectangles, then compares the distance between points that are close to the dividing line. If the distance between them is less than the minimum, the minimum is updated.
